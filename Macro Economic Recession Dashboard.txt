 Macro Economic Recession Dashboard - Concept

  Core Idea

  A real-time recession probability dashboard that aggregates 20+ economic indicators across regions, scores them, and presents an at-a-glance "economic health" view with deep drill-down capabilities.

  Key Indicators I'd Track (grouped by signal type)

  Leading (predict recessions 6-18 months ahead)
  - Yield curve spread (2Y-10Y) - the classic predictor
  - PMI (Manufacturing & Services)
  - Consumer Confidence Index
  - Building permits / Housing starts
  - Initial jobless claims trend
  - Leading Economic Index (LEI)
  - New orders / Inventories ratio

  Coincident (confirm current state)
  - GDP growth (QoQ, YoY)
  - Industrial production
  - Retail sales
  - Employment / Unemployment rate
  - Personal income growth

  Financial Stress
  - VIX (Fear Index)
  - Credit spreads (IG & HY)
  - Financial Conditions Index
  - Central bank rates + direction
  - Money supply (M2) growth

  Lagging (confirm we were/are in recession)
  - CPI / Inflation rate
  - Corporate profits
  - Consumer credit growth
  - Labor cost per unit

  Regional Coverage

  - World (aggregate composite score)
  - US (FRED API - richest data)
  - China (Caixin PMI, PBoC, NBS data)
  - India (RBI, GDP, Sensex)
  - Russia (CBR, RUB, CPI)
  - EMEA / Eurozone (ECB, Euro area PMI)
  - Switzerland (SNB, SECO, SMI)

  Data Sources (all free-tier)

  - FRED API - US economic data (excellent, free)
  - World Bank API - global GDP, inflation, employment
  - IMF Data API - cross-country comparisons
  - Alpha Vantage - market data, forex, commodities
  - OECD Data - leading indicators, PMI composites
  - Yahoo Finance - real-time market proxies

  Tech Stack

  - Next.js 15 (App Router, Server Components)
  - TypeScript strict mode
  - Tailwind CSS + custom design system (dark-mode-first)
  - Recharts for charts (or Tremor for dashboard-grade components)
  - TanStack Query for data fetching + caching
  - Server Actions for API proxy (hide keys, rate limit)

  Interactive Features

  - Region filter (tabs or dropdown)
  - Time range selector (1M, 3M, 6M, 1Y, 5Y, Max)
  - Indicator drill-down (click any indicator for full history + context)
  - Recession probability composite score per region
  - Comparison mode (overlay two regions)
  - Dark/light theme toggle

  Future Expansion (Phase 2+)

  - Asset price forecasting models (ML-based)
  - Portfolio risk scoring
  - Correlation matrix between indicators and asset classes
  - Alert system (email/push when indicators cross thresholds)

  My Recommendation for Phase 1

  Start with:
  1. Project scaffold + design system (dark theme, dashboard layout)
  2. US indicators first (FRED API is the best free source)
  3. Core dashboard with recession score, yield curve, PMI, GDP, inflation
  4. Region filter UI (populate US first, expand later)
  5. Interactive charts with time range selection
